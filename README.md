**Automatic DVD/Blu-ray ripping and transcoding — because ARM made my head hurt.**

`suarip.sh` is a single bash script that handles the full pipeline: detect disc → look up metadata → rip → transcode → copy to NAS → eject. Insert a disc, walk away, find a properly named MKV waiting for you on your media server.

---

## Features

- **Fully headless/unattended operation** — designed for a dedicated ripper box you SSH into
- **Dual drive routing** — internal drives use `ddrescue` (avoids SCSI compatibility issues), USB/external drives use MakeMKV
- **Blu-ray support** — MakeMKV handles BD+ and AACS encryption automatically
- **Smart metadata lookup** — multi-strategy OMDB search cleans disc labels and tries progressively simpler queries until it finds a match. Outputs `Movie Title (Year).mkv` compatible with Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby
- **VAAPI hardware encoding** — offloads transcoding to GPU for dramatically faster encodes (300-400+ fps vs ~25fps software)
- **ddrescue → dvdbackup fallback** — if ddrescue fails, automatically tries dvdbackup before giving up
- **Lock file** — prevents multiple instances from running simultaneously
- **MakeMKV timeout** — kills a hung MakeMKV process rather than waiting forever
- **NAS copy** — copies finished MKV to a network share automatically
- **Sleep inhibition** — prevents the system from sleeping during a rip/transcode
- **Push notifications** — ntfy.sh push notifications to your phone at every pipeline stage
- **Desktop notifications** — notifies on each pipeline stage and on completion
- **Eject guard** — prevents spurious error notifications when udev fires on disc eject
- **Preserves temp files on failure** — so you can manually recover a partial rip

---

---

## Installation

### Fedora / Nobara

> **Important:** `libdvdcss` is not in the default Fedora/Nobara repos due to legal restrictions. You must enable the RPM Fusion **tainted** repo first:

```bash
# Enable RPM Fusion free and tainted repos
sudo dnf install \
  https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm \
  https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm

sudo dnf install rpmfusion-free-release-tainted

# Now install libdvdcss and the rest
sudo dnf install libdvdcss HandBrake-cli curl python3 libnotify ddrescue dvdbackup
sudo modprobe sg && echo "sg" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/sg.conf
sudo usermod -aG cdrom $USER
```

Install MakeMKV from source: https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=224

Or install MakeMKV as a Flatpak (see Flatpak section below).

### Ubuntu / Debian
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:stebbins/handbrake-releases
sudo apt install handbrake-cli curl python3 libnotify-bin gddrescue dvdbackup
sudo apt install libdvd-pkg && sudo dpkg-reconfigure libdvd-pkg
sudo modprobe sg && echo "sg" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/sg.conf
sudo usermod -aG cdrom $USER
```
Install MakeMKV from source: https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=224

### Arch / Endeavour / CachyOS
```bash
sudo pacman -S handbrake-cli curl python3 libnotify ddrescue dvdbackup
sudo pacman -S libdvdcss libdvdread libdvdnav
sudo modprobe sg && echo "sg" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/sg.conf
sudo usermod -aG optical $USER
```
Install MakeMKV via AUR (`yay -S makemkv`) or from source.

> **Note:** On Arch-based systems the optical drive group is `optical`, not `cdrom`. Log out and back in after adding yourself to the group.

---

## MakeMKV as a Flatpak

If you install MakeMKV via Flatpak rather than native, you need to grant it device access so it can see your optical drives:

```bash
flatpak install flathub com.makemkv.MakeMKV

# Grant access to optical drives
flatpak override --user --device=all com.makemkv.MakeMKV
```

The script detects MakeMKV automatically whether installed natively or as a Flatpak.

---

## sudoers Entry

The script uses `sudo mount` and `sudo umount` for ISO mounting in the ddrescue pipeline. To allow passwordless operation (required for unattended/udev use), add a sudoers entry:

```bash
sudo visudo
```

Add this line at the bottom, replacing `yourusername` with your actual username:

```
yourusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/mount, /bin/umount
```

---

## Setup

1. Download `suarip.sh` and make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x suarip.sh
```

2. Edit the CONFIG section at the top of the script:
```bash
INTERNAL_DRIVE="/dev/sr0"               # Your internal optical drive
USB_DRIVE="/dev/sr1"                    # Your USB/external drive (leave empty if none)
TEMP_DIR="/mnt/scratch/suarip_temp"     # Scratch space for temp files
OUTPUT_DIR="$HOME/Videos/Movies"        # Local output before NAS copy
NAS_DIR="/mnt/nas/Movies"               # NAS destination (leave empty to skip)
OMDB_API_KEY="your_key_here"            # Free key from https://www.omdbapi.com/
NTFY_TOPIC="your-topic-here"            # ntfy.sh topic (leave empty to skip)
```

3. Get a free OMDB API key at https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx

4. (Optional) Set up ntfy.sh push notifications at https://ntfy.sh

5. Test it manually first:
```bash
./suarip.sh
```

---

## Usage

### Manual
```bash
./suarip.sh
```

### Automatic on disc insert (udev)

Create `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-suarip.rules` — replace `yourusername` in both places:

```
# Internal drive (sr0)
ACTION=="change", KERNEL=="sr0", ENV{ID_CDROM_MEDIA_DVD}=="1", \
RUN+="/bin/su yourusername -c '/home/yourusername/suarip.sh'"

# USB/external drive (sr1) - also catches Blu-ray
ACTION=="change", KERNEL=="sr1", ENV{ID_CDROM_MEDIA}=="1", \
RUN+="/bin/su yourusername -c '/home/yourusername/suarip.sh'"
```

Reload udev rules:
```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

> **Note:** The script includes an eject guard — when a rip finishes and the drive ejects, udev fires a second `change` event. The script detects no disc is present and exits silently, preventing spurious error notifications.

### Monitoring a running rip (SSH)
```bash
tail -f ~/.local/share/suarip/suarip_*.log
```

### Running headless (survives SSH disconnect)
```bash
tmux new -s rip
./suarip.sh
# Detach: Ctrl+B D
# Reattach: tmux attach -t rip
```

## Configuration Reference

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `INTERNAL_DRIVE` | `/dev/sr0` | Internal optical drive device |
| `USB_DRIVE` | `/dev/sr1` | USB/external drive (empty to disable) |
| `TEMP_DIR` | `/mnt/scratch/suarip_temp` | Scratch directory for temp files |
| `OUTPUT_DIR` | `~/Videos/Movies` | Local output directory |
| `NAS_DIR` | *(empty)* | NAS path — leave empty to skip |
| `OMDB_API_KEY` | *(your key)* | OMDB API key for metadata |
| `DVD_PRESET` | `HQ 720p30 Surround` | HandBrake preset for DVDs |
| `BLURAY_PRESET` | `HQ 1080p30 Surround` | HandBrake preset for Blu-ray |
| `RF_QUALITY` | `19` | RF quality (18-22 recommended, lower=better) |
| `NOTIFY` | `true` | Desktop notifications |
| `AUTO_EJECT` | `true` | Eject disc when done |
| `CONFIRM_METADATA` | `false` | Prompt to confirm/correct movie title |
| `MIN_TITLE_SECONDS` | `3600` | MakeMKV minimum title length (filters extras) |
| `MAKEMKV_TIMEOUT` | `3600` | MakeMKV timeout in seconds (60 min) |
| `DDRESCUE_RETRIES` | `3` | Bad sector retries for ddrescue |
| `USE_VAAPI` | `true` | Enable VAAPI GPU hardware encoding |
| `VAAPI_ENCODER` | `vaapi_h264` | HandBrake encoder flag name |
| `VAAPI_DETECT` | `h264_vaapi` | ffmpeg codec name used for VAAPI detection |
| `VAAPI_QUALITY` | `22` | VAAPI quality (higher=better, unlike RF) |
| `NTFY_TOPIC` | *(empty)* | ntfy.sh topic — leave empty to disable |
| `NTFY_SERVER` | `ntfy.sh` | ntfy server (change for self-hosted) |

> **VAAPI note:** `VAAPI_ENCODER` and `VAAPI_DETECT` are intentionally different values. HandBrake uses `vaapi_h264` as its `--encoder` flag, but the ffmpeg codec name shown in `HandBrakeCLI -e list` output is `h264_vaapi`. The script uses `VAAPI_DETECT` to check availability and `VAAPI_ENCODER` to invoke it.

## How It Works

### Drive routing
The script routes differently based on which drive has the disc:

```
Disc inserted
     │
     ├─ Blu-ray? ──────────────────► MakeMKV → HandBrake
     │
     ├─ DVD in USB drive? ──────────► MakeMKV → HandBrake
     │
     └─ DVD in internal drive? ──┬──► ddrescue → ISO → HandBrake
                                 └──► dvdbackup (fallback) → HandBrake
```

This routing exists because some internal drives have SCSI command compatibility issues with MakeMKV (see Drive Compatibility below) while USB drives tend to work fine with it.

### Metadata lookup
The script tries up to 5 progressively simpler OMDB searches before giving up:
1. Cleaned disc label + year hint (if year found in label)
2. Cleaned disc label, no year
3. Label with edition words stripped (Director's Cut, Special Edition, etc.)
4. First 3 words of label
5. First 2 words of label

On failure with `CONFIRM_METADATA=false` it uses the cleaned disc label title-cased. All attempted searches are logged for debugging.

### VAAPI hardware encoding
When `USE_VAAPI=true` the script checks whether VAAPI is available before each transcode. If available it uses GPU hardware encoding (300-400+ fps on supported hardware). If VAAPI fails mid-encode it automatically falls back to software encoding. Software encoding remains the fallback on systems without GPU support.

### Push notifications (ntfy.sh)
When `NTFY_TOPIC` is set, the script sends push notifications at every major stage: ripping started, transcoding started, copying to NAS, done, and on any error. Works with the free ntfy.sh service or a self-hosted ntfy instance.

## Known Limitations

- **Generic disc labels** — some discs have unhelpful labels like `SONY` or `COLUMBIA` rather than the movie title. OMDB will match incorrectly or not at all. Rename the output file manually after the rip. This is a disc mastering quirk, not something the script can reliably detect.
- **TV shows and specials** — OMDB is queried with `type=movie` only. TV episodes, series discs, and TV specials (e.g. Family Guy: Blue Harvest) won't match and will fall back to the disc label.
- **Single-word labels** — disc labels that are just one word are too ambiguous for reliable OMDB lookup. Common offenders: `SONY`, `COLUMBIA`, `WARNER`, `UNIVERSAL`.
- **Title detection** — HandBrake's longest title detection may default to title 1 on some discs. This is usually correct but edge cases exist. Check the output if a rip looks wrong.

---

## Drive Compatibility Notes

Hard-won knowledge from real-world testing:

**Internal drives and MakeMKV:** Some older internal drives have compatibility issues with MakeMKV's SCSI generic (`sg`) interface and will hang silently without ripping anything. If MakeMKV hangs on `info disc:0` but `dvdbackup` works fine, this is the issue. The script automatically routes internal drives through `ddrescue` to avoid this.

**Known problematic drives with MakeMKV:**
- HL-DT-ST DVD+-RW GH50N (firmware B103) — hangs at SDF lookup stage

**USB drives and dvdbackup:** USB optical drives tend to have poor compatibility with `dvdbackup` and `libdvdread`. If you get read errors or empty output with dvdbackup on a USB drive, use MakeMKV instead (which works well with USB).

**The general rule:** internal drives → ddrescue/dvdbackup, USB drives → MakeMKV.

**libdvdcss:** Make sure it's installed and up to date. An outdated libdvdcss will fail silently on some discs. On Fedora/Nobara this requires the RPM Fusion tainted repo (see Installation above). On Arch-based systems run `sudo pacman -S libdvdcss` to ensure you have the latest version.

**sg module:** MakeMKV requires the SCSI generic kernel module. Verify it's loaded with `lsmod | grep sg`. If not: `sudo modprobe sg`. To make it persist across reboots: `echo "sg" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/sg.conf`

## Tested Hardware

| Machine | CPU | GPU | OS | Notes |
|---------|-----|-----|----|-------|
| Custom build | AMD Ryzen 5 5600G | Radeon RX 6600 | Nobara Linux | VAAPI working, 300-400+ fps transcode |
| Mac Mini 5,1 | Intel Core i5-2520M | Intel HD 3000 | Ubuntu | Works, ~25fps software transcode |
| Custom AM1 build | AMD Athlon 5350 | AMD GCN | Endeavour OS | Works with ddrescue, ~25fps transcode |

## Troubleshooting

**MakeMKV hangs silently on disc scan:**
- Check `sg` module is loaded: `lsmod | grep sg`
- Try `makemkvcon f -l` to see if the drive is detected
- Try with explicit device path: `makemkvcon -r info dev:/dev/sr0`
- If internal drive, use ddrescue instead (see Drive Compatibility above)

**VAAPI not activating:**
- Check VAAPI is working: `vainfo`
- Check `/dev/dri/` exists and your user has access
- Run `HandBrakeCLI -e list 2>&1 | grep vaapi` — look for `h264_vaapi: err 0`
- Verify `VAAPI_DETECT="h264_vaapi"` and `VAAPI_ENCODER="vaapi_h264"` in config

**Disc label not found / OMDB returns wrong movie:**
- Check what the script logged for its search attempts
- Set `CONFIRM_METADATA=true` to manually correct titles
- Rename the output file manually and re-add to Jellyfin/Plex
- See Known Limitations above for generic label and TV show cases

**HandBrake error / invalid encoder:**
- Check `VAAPI_ENCODER` and `VAAPI_DETECT` values match your HandBrake version
- Try pointing at VIDEO_TS folder directly instead of ISO: `-i /path/VIDEO_TS`
- Check the full log for the actual error
- Verify the source file is valid: `ffprobe /path/to/source`

**sudo password prompt during unattended run:**
- Add the sudoers entry for mount/umount (see sudoers section above)

**Spurious "no disc" error notification on eject:**
- Ensure you are running v1.1-beta or later — the eject guard was added in this version

**Permission denied on temp directory:**
- Check ownership: `ls -la /mnt/scratch`
- Fix: `sudo chown $USER:$USER /mnt/scratch`

**Multiple MakeMKV processes running:**
- Kill them: `sudo killall makemkvcon`
- The lock file prevents this in normal operation but manual runs can stack up

**NAS copy fails:**
- Verify the share is mounted: `mountpoint /mnt/nas`
- Check credentials file permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.nascredentials`
- The script saves locally and warns if NAS is unavailable

## Why Not ARM?

[Automatic Ripping Machine](https://github.com/automatic-ripping-machine/automatic-ripping-machine) is a great project but can be complex to set up and maintain, especially on non-standard hardware or distros. This script is a single bash file with no Docker, no web UI, no database — just insert disc, get MKV.

---

## Changelog

### v1.6-beta
- Added rescue mode prompt — on startup a 10 second prompt asks if you want the ddrescue recovery pipeline (press 'r'). Times out and defaults to normal MakeMKV mode automatically. Only shown in interactive terminal sessions, skipped when running headless via udev
- Rescue mode preserves temp files on failure for manual recovery; normal mode now cleans up temp files on failure as well as success
- Added startup cleanup of leftover temp files from previous failed/interrupted runs
- Added `RESCUE_PROMPT_TIMEOUT` config option (default 10s, set to 0 to disable prompt)
- Added `⚠️ FILL THIS IN` warnings on `OMDB_API_KEY` and `NTFY_TOPIC` config lines
- Added scratch drive controller note to `TEMP_DIR` config comment
- ddrescue pipeline now clearly labelled as rescue mode only in comments and log output

### v1.5-beta
- Internal drive now routes through MakeMKV instead of ddrescue — ddrescue produced corrupt ISOs when scratch drive is on a separate ASMedia SATA controller causing controller crosstalk during simultaneous read/write. MakeMKV works correctly on the internal drive with the 2016 HL-DT-ST replacement drive
- ddrescue pipeline (rip_ddrescue, rip_dvdbackup_direct) remains intact in the script and can be re-enabled manually for damaged disc recovery if needed
- Falls back to ddrescue if MakeMKV is not found on internal drive path

### v1.4-beta
- Fixed silent failure when `systemd-inhibit` is installed but broken (e.g. after a Nobara update) — script now tests `systemd-inhibit` before using it and falls through to normal execution if broken rather than silently exiting
- Added `side[ab12]` stripping to disc label cleaner — labels like `Idiocracy Sidea` now clean to `Idiocracy` for correct OMDB lookup

### v1.3-beta
- Fixed VAAPI transcode missing `--preset` flag — previously VAAPI encodes had no resolution or H.264 level set, producing 360p files with level 0 metadata that Jellyfin/Plex could not transcode via HLS. Adding `--preset` alongside `--encoder vaapi_h264` fixes resolution, audio, and H.264 profile/level correctly. **If you ripped movies with v1.2-beta or earlier using VAAPI, re-rip them.**

### v1.2-beta
- Fixed VAAPI detection — `VAAPI_ENCODER` (HandBrake flag) and `VAAPI_DETECT` (ffmpeg codec name) are now separate config values to correctly handle the naming difference between HandBrake and ffmpeg
- VAAPI now reliably activates on supported hardware (300-400+ fps confirmed)
- VAAPI encode failure now falls back to software automatically rather than erroring out

### v1.1-beta
- Added ntfy.sh push notifications — phone alerts at ripping, transcoding, NAS copy, completion, and error stages
- Added eject guard — prevents spurious "no disc" error notifications when udev fires on disc eject
- Added ntfy notifications to ddrescue rip path (previously only MakeMKV path had them)
- Version bump

### v1.0-beta
- Initial release
- Dual drive routing — internal drives use ddrescue, USB/external use MakeMKV
- Multi-strategy OMDB metadata lookup (5 progressively simpler search attempts)
- ddrescue → dvdbackup automatic fallback
- Lock file prevents multiple simultaneous instances
- MakeMKV timeout prevents indefinite hangs
- NAS copy with mount detection and local fallback
- Sleep inhibition via systemd-inhibit
- Desktop notifications on each pipeline stage
- Fully headless/unattended operation with `CONFIRM_METADATA=false`
- udev auto-trigger support for disc insert automation
- Tested on Nobara, Ubuntu, and Endeavour OS
